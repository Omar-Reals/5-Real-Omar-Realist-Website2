	<div id="normaltext"><p>Hello my name is Omar Sautia-Real. To the real world where fun meets film, graphic design, and web design I am your guy. In my free time I engage in thought provoking ideas, exploring the internet, playing fantasy football, loving my dogs, exploring TV and film Elements, all with a cup of coffee inside of my hand.&nbsp;</p></div>
		<div id="normaltext2"><p>On my home page I made a HTML skeleton and use div lay outs to not bunch up all of my texts while using CSS to design the way that I wanted MY website to look like. I used classes and id's throughout the page and used margining and padding with my three columns and my text. In my three columns I have buttons that lead to other pages I also have a header that also has links and a picture of a very cute dog right next to my HERO. Whenever you are to hover over my three collums a collum sticks out and I have a icon in my website.
